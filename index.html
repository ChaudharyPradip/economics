    <h1>Foreign Exchange Market</h1>
    <p>The foreign exchange market (Forex, FX, or currency market) is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC)
        market
        for the trading of currencies. This market determines foreign exchange rates for every currency. It includes all
        aspects
        of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of trading volume, it is
        by far
        the largest market in the world, followed by the credit market.</p>
    <p>The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. Financial centers around the world
        function as
        anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the
        exception of
        weekends. Since currencies are always traded in pairs, the foreign exchange market does not set a currency's
        absolute
        value but rather determines its relative value by setting the market price of one currency if paid for with
        another. Ex:
        USD 1 is worth X CAD, or CHF, or JPY, etc.</p>
    <p>The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions and operates on several levels. Behind the
        scenes,
        banks turn to a smaller number of financial firms known as "dealers", who are involved in large quantities of
        foreign
        exchange trading. Most foreign exchange dealers are banks, so this behind-the-scenes market is sometimes called
        the
        "interbank market" (although a few insurance companies and other kinds of financial firms are involved). Trades
        between
        foreign exchange dealers can be very large, involving hundreds of millions of dollars. Because of the
        sovereignty issue
        when involving two currencies, Forex has little (if any) supervisory entity regulating its actions.</p>
    <p>The foreign exchange market assists international trade and investments by enabling currency conversion. For
        example, it
        permits a business in the United States to import goods from European Union member states, especially Eurozone
        members,
        and pay Euros, even though its income is in United States dollars. It also supports direct speculation and
        evaluation
        relative to the value of currencies and the carry trade speculation, based on the differential interest rate
        between two
        currencies.</p>
    <p>In a typical foreign exchange transaction, a party purchases some quantity of one currency by paying with some
        quantity
        of another currency.</p>
    <p>The modern foreign exchange market began forming during the 1970s. This followed three decades of government
        restrictions on foreign exchange transactions under the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, which set
        out the
        rules for commercial and financial relations among the world's major industrial states after World War II.
        Countries
        gradually switched to floating exchange rates from the previous exchange rate regime, which remained fixed per
        the
        Bretton Woods system.</p>
    <p>The foreign exchange market is unique because of the following characteristics:
    <ul>
        <li>its huge trading volume, representing the largest asset class in the world leading to high liquidity;</li>
        <li>its geographical dispersion;</li>
        <li>its continuous operation: 24 hours a day except for weekends, i.e., trading from 22:00 GMT on Sunday
            (Sydney) until
            22:00 GMT Friday (New York);</li>
        <li>the variety of factors that affect exchange rates;</li>
        <li>the low margins of relative profit compared with other markets of fixed income; and</li>
        <li>the use of leverage to enhance profit and loss margins and with respect to account size.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>As such, it has been referred to as the market closest to the ideal of perfect competition, notwithstanding
        currency
        intervention by central banks.</p>
    <p>According to the Bank for International Settlements, the preliminary global results from the 2019 Triennial
        Central Bank
        Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Activity show that trading in foreign exchange markets
        averaged
        $6.6 trillion per day in April 2019. This is up from $5.1 trillion in April 2016. Measured by value, foreign
        exchange
        swaps were traded more than any other instrument in April 2019, at $3.2 trillion per day, followed by spot
        trading at $2
        trillion.[3]

        The $6.6 trillion break-down is as follows:</p>
